3.Human can understand the language of words and phrases but computer cannot understand,for computer there is anthor language known as Machine level language.
4.Java is known as platform independent because it uses the concept of  generating the byte code of the high level program ,and then run that byte code(intermediate code).
5.The Java compiler "Java c" compiles the source code and produces platform independent code called "Byte code".
6.The byte code which is generated by the compiler is not native in any platform.
